##Project Description:
Examine how household energy usage varies over a 2-day period in Febuary, 2007.
Assignment uses "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.
The dataset measures the electric power consumption in one household with a 1 minute sampling rate
  over a period of 4 years.
  
Database found here:  https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:

* Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
* Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
* Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
* Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
* Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
* Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
* Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
* Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
* Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.

##Project Instructions:
1. Only use dates 2/1/07 & 2/2/07
2. Construct 4 plots as shown in figure files.
   a. Construct the plot and save it as a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels.
   b. Name each plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
   c. Create R source code file and name plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.
   d. Add PNG files & R code file to git repo
